# Project 1 - College Recruitment Improvement Study

The CCM Department of Information Technologies seeks to improve its recruitment process and increase the number of students in its computing classes and majors. A survey is administered every Fall semester for entry-level computing classes and computer literacy courses (for non-majors). This program will showcase which/when/where/why students are taking their classes using data from the survey, in order for the CCM Department of Information Technologies to focus their recruiting efforts in areas that are successful for under-represented groups.

## 4 Data Science Questions

These are the four data science questions that I answered in this Project. 
1. **Instructor Q.** Which computing areas had the highest interest for those students interested in taking more computing classes?
2. **Student Q.** What sources are most frequent for students to hear about CCM's Computer Science programs?
3. **Student Q.** Which factors most motivate students to attend CCM's Computer Science programs?
4. **Student Q.** Which previous computing experiences have had the highest impact for students to enroll?

Keep in mind that the assignment said to answer 2 instructor assigned questions and 2 questions that I made in Assignment #1, however, only 1 question was assigned by the instructor. For this reason, I have selected a third question that I made in Assignment #1.

## Project Files

You can find 4 different project files in this GitHub Repository.
1. **Fall2024.csv** is the CSV file of the data from the survey. This file was not touched in any way, and it is the data that we will need to clean and analyze.
2. **CleanedFall2024.csv** is the CSV file of the data from the survey after cleaning. It was cleaned in the P1A2.ipynb file.
3. **P1A2.ipynb** is the Jupyter Notebook file that we ran to clean our survey data file (Fall2024.csv) and it saved the cleaned CSV file as CleanedFall2024.csv
4. **P1A3.ipynb** is the Jupyter Notebook file that analyzes the cleaned data in CleanedFall2024.csv to answer the 4 data science questions. It showcases the commands used to clean up the data further for each question, plots the data in an easy to read format, and conducts an analysis for each of them, sometimes even adding more graphs and data analysis commands to create a better understanding or verify an analysis.
