# Project 1 - College Recruitment Improvement Study

The CCM Department of Information Technologies seeks to improve its recruitment process and increase the number of students in its computing classes and majors. A survey is administered every Fall semester for entry-level computing classes and computer literacy courses (for non-majors). This program will showcase which/when/where/why students are taking their classes using data from the survey, in order for the CCM Department of Information Technologies to focus their recruiting efforts in areas that are successful for under-represented groups.
